🖥️ SimpleRISC Emulator
📌 Overview
SimpleRISC is a Python-based emulator that simulates a basic RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture. It allows users to input and execute simplified assembly-like instructions in real time. This project was designed to deepen understanding of low-level architecture concepts like registers, memory access, and control flow.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3

Tools: Command-line interface (CLI)

🚀 Features:
Register Simulation: Simulates four general-purpose registers (R1–R4)

Instruction Support: Supports instructions like LOAD, STORE, ADD, SUB, MUL, JUMP, conditional branching, and HALT

Memory Management: Emulates memory storage via dictionary

Interactive Program Input: Users can input instructions manually through the terminal

👩‍💻 My Role:
I designed and built the entire emulator, including the instruction parser, execution loop, memory/register management, and user interface. This project was a hands-on way to apply my understanding of computer architecture and Python programming.

📘 Lessons Learned:
Gained a deeper understanding of how CPU instructions are processed

Improved Python structuring and control flow logic

Learned how to simulate low-level computing concepts using high-level languages
